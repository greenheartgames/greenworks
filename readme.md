# Greenworks

* Greenworks is a [node.js addon](https://nodejs.org/api/addons.html) that
allows you to integrate your HTML5 game (or app) with
[Steamworks](https://partner.steamgames.com/) by exposing a number of
Steamworks APIs to JavaScript.
* Greenworks was originally developed by
[Greenheart Games](http://www.greenheartgames.com) to enable Steam integration
in [Game Dev Tycoon](http://www.greenheartgames.com/app/game-dev-tycoon/).
Since then, it has been open-sourced and is
[used in many other projects](https://github.com/greenheartgames/greenworks/wiki/Apps-games-using-greenworks).
* Currently Greenworks supports:
  * node v0.8, v0.10, v0.12, v4, v5, v6, v7, v8, v9 and v10+
  * NW.js v0.8, v0.11+
  * Electron v1.0.0+
  * Steam SDK v1.62
* Greenworks is built using [Native Abstractions for Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/nan) to
support different node versions.
* The project is currently funded by Greenheart Games and other
donors.
